# Linear Regression (STAT 512) Final Project (Professor Salaries)
Final project for STAT 512 at Purdue. 

Data write up is [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/carData/Salaries.html)

[CSV](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/Salaries.csv)

The structure of the project is as follows:

# Code

Where the CSV and relevant R code is stored. There is also a .tex file for an explanation of code, which we should all contribute to. 

# Presentation

The beamer presentation will be found here. There should be no code in this section. We will be using my beamer presentation from the summer/fall as an example of what to do.

# Write Up

The final write up is here. We will be using my write up from the summer as an example of what to do.
