# Linear Regression (STAT 512) Final Project (Professor Salaries)
Final project for STAT 512 at Purdue. lo

Data write up is [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/carData/Salaries.html)

[CSV](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/Salaries.csv)

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

The structure of the project is as follows:

## Code

Where the CSV and relevant R code is stored. There is also a .tex file for an explanation of code, which we should all contribute to. 

## Presentation

The beamer presentation will be found here. There should be no code in this section. We will be using my beamer presentation from the summer/fall as an example of what to do.

## Write Up

The final write up is here. We will be using my write up from the summer as an example of what to do. 

## Overleaf

The project is also linked to overleaf. The link for the project is [here](https://www.overleaf.com/2813665139nmbvpqfqhttf). Make sure that when you are working on the project, you click on MENU in the top left, scroll to the SYNC section, click on GitHub, and click on the Pull Changes from GitHub so that way you have the most up to date version. After making any changes, click on the Push Overleaf changes to GitHub.

# Why are we using GitHub/Overleaf?

GitHub is a powerful way of storing and retrieving data. It's commonly used in many programming environments due to its ease of use (relatively speaking) and the fact that it tracks all of the changes made; so if someone in the group messes something up, or there is a change down the line that is not benefitial to the long term, then we can go back and undo it.

Overleaf is useful because, while GitHub is useful for markdown and storing/retrieving files, Overleaf allows us to write in LaTeX, a powerful write up lanaguage meant for mathematics/statistics. This will allow our presentation and write up to look professionally done with minimal effort. 

For more information on GitHub, check out this link [here](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-github-and-why-should-i-use-it-2071946). For more information on LaTeX, check out this [link](https://bitesizebio.com/13653/5-reasons-to-use-latex-the-typesetting-engine-not-the-gloves/). For more information on Overleaf/Sharelatex/LaTeX, check out this [pdf](https://www.google.com/search?q=Overleaf).

It is not essential that you guys are pros at doing this. These projects and links are more for me, so that things are organized and I have a way of accessing files remotely and compiling our final write up. As a result, you do not need to use these tools, although I do recommend learning them and trying them out at least since they are very useful for future projects. If everyone is familiar with these types of things, it really streamlines the whole process and allows for us to all work on our own time. 

# Quick Guide to GitHub

You want to start by cloning the repo (short for repository. If you're running Windows, click [here](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32) to download GitHub for desktop. For Mac, click [here](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin) to download GitHub for desktop. I'm assuming none of you are using Linux, but if you are you should have git natively downloaded on your OS.

The way GitHub works is that you have a local version of the project. You can make whatever changes you want to the local version of the project without influencing the global version, which we all have. When you decide that you want to publish changes so that we can all see it, you'll want to Push you're changes. You'll need to attach a title of what you changed, and then quick description of the changes in order to push it the universal version.

Periodically, you'll want to pull changes. This pulls from the universal project, and updates your local version. This will erase all changes, so you'll want to maybe save your changes elsewhere or push the changes if you're afraid of something being erased. 

For now, I think this is all you need to know in order to get started. [Here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is a quickguide to it, which also introduces the concept of branches as well (although I won't really be utilizing this fact). [Here](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/github-tutorial) is a more in depth guide.
